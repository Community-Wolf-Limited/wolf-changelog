## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed broken shared links**: Resolved an issue where some shared links could incorrectly land on a 404 page instead of the intended starting page
- **Preserved link parameters**: When a redirect is needed, any parameters included in the link are kept so users still land in the right context

## Improvements

- **More resilient link handling**: The app now better tolerates unusual or malformed link formats from external sources
