## Improvements

- **Clearer confirmations**: Users now get more consistent acknowledgement when completing key actions, helping reduce confusion and repeat attempts
- **More consistent staff handling**: Improved staff-related behaviour to reduce duplicates and improve day-to-day reliability
- **Security hardening**: Updated dependencies to address a reported security issue

## Bug Fixes

- **Report interactions**: Fixed an issue where a “More Info” action could reference the wrong report in some cases
