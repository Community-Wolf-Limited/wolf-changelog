## What's New

- **Custom Brand Styling**: Organisations can now configure their own brand colours, logo, font, and corner roundness for public-facing surveys
- **Organisation Profile Page**: New dedicated page for managing organisation details and public branding settings
- **Font Selection**: Choose from 11 professional fonts including Inter, Roboto, Poppins, and more
- **Dynamic Corner Styling**: Select from five border radius options (None, Small, Medium, Large, Full) that apply across all survey elements

## Improvements

- **Streamlined Settings**: Renamed "Profile" to "Organisation Profile" in the sidebar for clarity
- **Light Mode Defaults**: Public surveys now default to a clean light theme matching the platform styling
- **Reset Functionality**: "Reset to Wolf Defaults" now preserves your enabled/disabled setting while resetting styling values
- **Consistent Styling**: Border radius settings now apply uniformly to all cards, buttons, and chips on surveys

## How It Works

1. Navigate to **Settings → Organisation Profile**
2. Switch to the **Public Branding** tab
3. Toggle **Custom Branding** on to enable your settings
4. Customise colours, logo, font, and corner roundness
5. Click **Save Branding** to apply changes to your public surveys
