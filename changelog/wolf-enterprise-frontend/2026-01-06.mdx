## What's New

- **Radar tab**: A new analytics tool in Group Agents that helps you understand what's happening across your monitored WhatsApp groups
- **Keyword tracking**: Create a personal watchlist of keywords and phrases to monitor across your groups. See how often they appear and track changes over time
- **Sentiment analysis**: Get an automatic breakdown of message sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) to gauge the mood of conversations
- **User activity insights**: See which participants are most active and how their message patterns relate to your tracked keywords
- **Trending terms**: Discover the most frequently used terms across your monitored groups

## Improvements

- **Flexible time windows**: Analyze messages over 7, 14, 30, or 60 day periods
- **Feed-based scoping**: Use your existing Feed decks to scope Radar analytics, or select individual groups
- **Match type options**: Choose between substring matching (finds "car" in "racecar") or exact word matching for more precise tracking
- **Trend comparisons**: See how keyword counts have changed compared to the previous period with delta indicators
