## What's New

- **Message Feeds**: Monitor messages from multiple groups side-by-side in a multi-column layout
- **Feed Decks**: Save and switch between named feed configurations to organise different monitoring views
- **Flexible columns**: Add groups as columns (including multi-select) to build a monitoring view quickly

## Improvements

- **Live updates**: Feeds refresh automatically as new messages arrive, reducing the need to manually refresh while monitoring
- **Layout polish**: Improved wide-layout containment to keep the feed board easier to use on smaller screens
