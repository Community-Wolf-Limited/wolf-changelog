- **Survey Outcomes Viewer**: Browse all survey submissions in a detailed table showing dates, ratings, concerns, environmental factors, and locations
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualise survey data with KPIs, rating distribution charts, and breakdowns of top concerns and environmental factors

  - **Heatmap View**: See density of submissions and areas of concern at a glance
  - **Pins View**: Explore individual submissions with clustered markers for better performance

## Improvements

  - Environmental factors (e.g., poor lighting, graffiti)
- **Multi-field Search**: Search across notes, concerns, and environmental factors simultaneously

- **Pagination**: Efficiently browse large numbers of submissions with cursor-based pagination
