## Improvements

- **Default report view**: Reports now show all reports by default instead of automatically filtering by organisation areas.
- **Verified filter control**: Verified status filtering only applies when explicitly enabled by users.

## Bug Fixes

- **Report filtering**: Fixed issue where reports were being filtered automatically when users expected to see all reports.
- **Sort consistency**: Improved sorting behaviour to match user preferences across all report views.
