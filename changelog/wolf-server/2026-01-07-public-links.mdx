## What's New

- **Public Survey Links**: Generate shareable links that allow anyone to submit safety surveys without logging in
- **Multiple Named Links**: Create unlimited survey links per organization, each with a unique name for tracking different campaigns or areas
- **Short URL Support**: Automatically generate friendly short URLs for easy sharing on social media and printed materials
- **Anonymous Attribution**: Public submissions are tracked back to your organization while keeping respondents anonymous

## Improvements

- **Link Management**: Enable, disable, or rotate links at any time to control when surveys are accepting responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse with automatic throttling of suspicious traffic
- **Risk-Based Verification**: Smart captcha challenges only appear when unusual activity is detected
