## Improvements

- **Persistent media links**: Images and videos in skill reports now use permanent storage URLs instead of temporary links that could expire
- **Optimised message storage**: Reduced storage footprint for messages with media attachments, improving database efficiency
- **Automatic media sync**: Skill reports are now automatically updated with persistent media links once processing completes
