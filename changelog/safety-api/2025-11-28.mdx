## What's New

- **Single Location Predictions**: Send any latitude/longitude in Chicago and receive a complete crime probability distribution with risk level assessment

- **Batch Predictions**: Query up to 100 locations in a single request with summary statistics across all locations

- **Route Risk Assessment**: Calculate cumulative crime risk along a travel route with segment-by-segment breakdown and customizable risk weighting

## New Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Single Prediction | Get crime probabilities for any location |
| Batch Prediction | Compare multiple locations at once |
| Route Risk | Assess safety along a planned route |
| Coverage Info | Check available geographic bounds |

## What You Get Back

For each prediction request, you receive:
- Probability breakdown across 6 crime categories
- Dominant crime type and confidence level
- Overall risk classification (Low, Moderate, High, Very High)
- Grid cell information for the queried location

## Use Cases

- **Delivery routing**: Identify safer routes for drivers
- **Real estate**: Compare neighborhood safety profiles
- **Urban planning**: Understand crime distribution patterns
- **Personal safety**: Plan safer travel routes

## Model Performance

- 4.50% mean absolute error (new best!)
- All crime categories balanced below 6% individual error
- Strong correlation between predicted and actual patterns
