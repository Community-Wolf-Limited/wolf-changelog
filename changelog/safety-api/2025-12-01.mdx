## What's New

- **Hexagonal Grid System**: Migrated from custom square grids to the industry-standard H3 hexagonal system used by major rideshare and logistics companies

- **Globally Unique Cell IDs**: Every prediction cell now has a unique identifier that works anywhere on Earth, enabling multi-city expansion

## Improvements

- **Prediction error reduced to 4.32%** - 4% improvement from the previous 4.50%
- **Training time reduced by 33%** - Faster model updates and iterations
- **Cleaner spatial relationships** - Each cell has exactly 6 neighbors at consistent distances

## Why Hexagons?

Unlike squares where corners are 40% farther from the center than edges, hexagons have uniform neighbor distances. This creates more consistent spatial patterns for the model to learn, resulting in better predictions.

## What This Enables

- Consistent cell coverage across any city globally
- Standardized cell sizes (~5 km² per cell)
- Foundation for multi-city expansion
- Industry-compatible cell identifiers for integrations
