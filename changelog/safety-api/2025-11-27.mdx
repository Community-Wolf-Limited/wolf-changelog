## What's New

- **Redesigned Crime Categories**: Restructured crime classifications into more balanced and meaningful groups for better predictions

- **Probability Distribution Focus**: Shifted focus from simple classification to full probability distributions - now providing the complete picture of crime likelihood

## Improvements

- **Overall prediction error reduced to 4.74%** - When we say "35% chance of theft," the actual value is typically between 30-40%
- Improved prediction quality across all crime types
- Better balance between common and rare crime categories

## New Crime Categories

- **Theft & Burglary**: All theft-related incidents grouped together
- **Battery & Assault**: Physical altercations and violence
- **Vehicle & Property Damage**: Auto theft, vandalism, and property crimes
- **Serious Violent**: High-severity incidents requiring immediate attention
- **Other**: Remaining categories including drug offenses and public order

## What This Means For Users

Previously, the system would tell you "this area is high risk for property crime." Now it tells you the complete breakdown: "35% theft risk, 25% assault risk, 20% quiet, 15% vehicle damage, 5% other." This full distribution enables better decision-making.
