version: "1.0"

## What's New

- **Daily Predictions**: Get expected crime counts for any specific day, not just weekly aggregates

- **Hourly Breakdowns**: Understand when crime is most likely throughout the day with peak hour analysis

- **Detailed Crime Types**: See breakdown within categories (e.g., within "Theft", what percentage is vehicle break-ins vs shoplifting)

- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical bounds on predictions (e.g., "expect 12 crimes, 95% confidence between 8-17")

## Two Complementary Models

The API now provides insights from two models in a single response:

| Model | Strengths |
|-------|-----------|
| **Primary (Deep Learning)** | Weekly patterns, spatial relationships, probability distributions |
| **Baseline (Statistical)** | Daily/hourly precision, specific crime types, confidence intervals |

## New Response Fields

Predictions now include:
- **Expected daily counts** by crime bucket
- **Peak hours** for each crime type with risk multipliers
- **Top 15 specific crime types** within each category
- **Time factors** (day-of-week effect, seasonal patterns, recent trends)
- **Historical comparisons** (vs day-of-week average, monthly average, recent 4-week average)

## Use Cases

- "What's the worst hour for theft in this area?" - Peak hour analysis
- "Is today above or below normal?" - Historical comparison
- "What specific crimes should I worry about?" - Detailed type breakdown
- "How confident are you in this prediction?" - 95% confidence intervals

## Performance

All 10 cities now have baseline models that train in under 60 seconds, enabling rapid updates as new data becomes available.
