## What's New

- **Expected Crime Counts**: The model now predicts not just "what type of crime" but also "how many crimes" to expect in each area

- **Per-Type Volume Breakdown**: Get expected counts broken down by crime category (e.g., "expect 3 thefts, 2 assaults this week")

## Before vs After

**Before**: "This area has 35% theft probability, 25% assault"
**After**: "This area has 35% theft (expect ~3 incidents), 25% assault (expect ~2 incidents), 8.5 total crimes expected"

## All Cities Updated

Every city model has been retrained with dual prediction capabilities:

| City | Distribution Error | Count Correlation |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| London | 3.54% | 0.62 |
| Chicago | 3.99% | 0.88 |
| NYC | 4.33% | 0.77 |
| LA | 4.44% | 0.80 |
| Philadelphia | 4.69% | 0.87 |
| SF | 4.79% | 0.79 |
| Denver | 4.82% | 0.62 |
| Toronto | 4.82% | 0.79 |
| Boston | 5.82% | 0.85 |
| Seattle | 6.19% | 0.86 |

## Improvements

- **8 cities now under 5% error** (up from 5)
- Boston improved from 7.85% to 5.82% error
- SF improved from 6.26% to 4.79% error
- Average error across all cities: 4.74%

## API Response Updates

All prediction endpoints now include:
- `expected_total`: Total crimes expected in the time period
- `expected_counts`: Breakdown by crime type
- `count_mae`: Model accuracy for volume predictions
