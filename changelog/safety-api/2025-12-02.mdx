## What's New

- **London Coverage**: Full crime prediction support for Greater London using Metropolitan Police data

- **Unified API with Auto-Routing**: Send coordinates from any supported city - the API automatically detects location and routes to the correct model

- **International Expansion**: First cross-Atlantic deployment, proving the system works with different police data formats and crime categorizations

## Coverage Details

| City | Grid Cells | Prediction Accuracy |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| Chicago | 278 | 4.32% error |
| London | 590 | 4.02% error |

## How It Works

No changes needed to your integration. Simply send coordinates:
- Chicago coordinates receive Chicago predictions
- London coordinates receive London predictions
- Unsupported locations return a clear "not covered" response

## London-Specific Features

- Adapted to UK crime categorization from Met Police data
- 590 prediction cells covering Greater London
- Full probability distributions matching Chicago format
